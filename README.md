My own implementation of String in C++.

It also contains unit tests for each operator.
The main application Logview uses String.
It parses logview and execute on of three options:
1) Prints file
2) Prints number of bytes
3) Prints hosts

The biggest challange was to create a test cases which will be sufficent
